# lensingGW
Jupyter notebook describing the effect of magnification on the observed rates of gravitational wave mergers as a function of distance/chirp-mass. The provided examples are intended to be instructive and easy to experiment with.

The lensing depths for mu>10 contained in `plot` are a digitized version of figure 3 from [Oguri 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02584).
